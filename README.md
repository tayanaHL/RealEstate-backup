# USER STORIES

Here I have a Real Estate API based in the GTA, for those looking to own or rent a property.

 ## I want users to be able to:

 - Create an account
 - Sign in
 - To look into the specifics of what they're looking for. For example, if someone is just looking to own, they have the option to only see properies for sale and not for rent, and vice versa.

 - The ability to do search filters for their preferences. For example, if someone is specifically looking for a home with +3 bedrooms, a 1 bedroom and 1 bath apartment, or a property for less than CAD $250,000 (good luck finding that). 

 - The ability to pick a location or multiple locations in the GTA. A few of the options included will be, Toronto, Oakville, Burlington, Hamilton and London.
 
 - The ability to scroll down the feed to view propeties for rent and propeties for sale according to the user's preferences.

 - The ability to click on a property to view the description, more images of the property and further info...
